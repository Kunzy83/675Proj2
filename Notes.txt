Types if potential sends to give out work assignments...
    Broadcast
    Scatter

Ways to aggregate all work together into process 0...
    Gather




Parts to work on...
    [In Progress] Create programmer-defined type that corresponds to one record from the file.

    [In Progress] Reading in the file
        use MPI_File_open to get file handle fh
        use fh with MPI_File_read to get data from file

    [TODO] Create a new communicator with all rank processes from MPI_COMM_WORLD EXCEPT Error Reporting rank

    [TODO] spreading out work to all the processes (hopefully i log(n) time)
        Will have to use Scatter somehow
        DO NOT GIVE Error Reporting rank ANY DATA TO WORK ON


    [TODO] aggregating all work
        Will have to use MPI_Reduce


    [TODO] function to give to all processes to keep track of data summations

    [TODO] Error reporting
        figure out how this rank knows when to quit
